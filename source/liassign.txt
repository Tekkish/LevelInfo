// -------------------------
// LevelInfo Assignment Lump
// -------------------------
//
// This file allows you to customize LevelInfo's power-up timers without having to modify any source code. It is
// processed when found in the root of any loaded archive. If multiple lumps are detected, only the last one in the
// load order will be read. A maximum of 25 power-ups can be assigned at once.
//
// Power-up assignments consist of 4 comma-separated values that are differentiated by newlines. The order of the list
// is determined by the order of the input. The syntax for adding power-ups is straightforward:
//
// PowerClass, PowerName, BerserkToken, PowerColor
//
// PowerClass is the class name assigned to a power-up. PowerName is the name you wish to display in the list. A
// BerserkToken is used to determine whether or not a power-up acts like the berserk pack (it lasts until the end of a
// map). Use "berserk" to indicate yes or "calm" to indicate no. This is checked when the "show berserk status" option
// is disabled.
//
// PowerColor is the color you wish to use when "show colored text" is enabled. This uses the ZDoom color codes found
// at "https://zdoom.org/wiki/Print#Colors". If you do not wish to specify a color, you can set this to "default"
// and the internal default (dark gray) will be used.
//
// Here are some examples:
//
// PowerStrength, Berserk, berserk, g
//
// This will add a power-up with the "PowerStrength" class, display "Berserk" in the list, designate that it's to be
// treated like a berserk pack, and use the red color.
//
// PowerInvisibility, Hidden, calm, default
//
// This will add a power-up with the "PowerInvisibility" class, display "Hidden" in the list, designate that it's
// not to be treated like a berserk pack, and use the default color.
//
// In addition to power-ups, you can also specify a player class to restrict them to. This can be used with mods that
// employ different power-ups for each player class. To have a power-up show only when a specific class is loaded, use
// the class identifier:
//
// Class DoomPlayer
//     PowerInvulnerable, Immune, calm, k
//
// This will tell LevelInfo to only include the invulnerability power-up when the "DoomPlayer" class has been detected.
// You can combine this with the "Class Unset" command to have power-ups appear with all player classes:
//
// Class DoomPlayer
//     PowerInvulnerable, Immune, calm, k
//     PowerInvisibility, Hidden, calm, n
// Class Unset
// PowerIronfeet, Suit, calm, d
//
// The above will show the invulnerability and invisibility power-ups when "DoomPlayer" is detected and display the rad
// suit to all player classes.
//
// For a final example, see the default configuration below. It will display the appropriate power-up timers for Doom,
// Heretic, and Hexen.
